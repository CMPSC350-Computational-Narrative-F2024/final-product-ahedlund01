# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

Polar Opposites Story Generator

## Description

The diffculties we have encountered so far is related to the API and the amounts of tokens allocated be call, it is hard to alter the length of output generated additionally the run time is long. This makes it annoying to observe changes made in the code. It has been enjoyable using the random creativity of the AI generating themes beacuse it comes up with scnearios that we would not think of. The concpet has not changed fundamentally however we have had to make changes to the logic to make sure that the output is of required length.

TODO: Provide a 3-5 sentence description of your progress to this point. What has been
difficult? What has been enjoyable? Has your concept changed or shifted in any meaningful way?

## Peer Feedback

How are you picking the theme for you story generation?
What would do to make sure the narritive is coherent?
Any other prompting techinques you plan using beside chain prompting?


### Unstructured peer feedback

Audrey was very fastinated by our program's ability to create a document with consistent syntax throughout, and admired the use of generating chunks to promote this consistency. She also was fascinated by the images' abilities to portray the "Polar Opposites" theme in a very accurate manner. She suggests potentially experimenting with more LLMs to ensure the one being used produces the most accurate results, as well as implementing changes to the prompts to account for any token or word limit requirements that may be desired with the project.

## Persisting challenges

The challenges that persist are to ensure that the generated product is up to the required length. The generation of enough text remains hard to get consitently logner, we have tried differernt apporaches with both prompting the API to make it longer and also incorporating a minimum token limit. The changes have made progress however it is not yet of the desired length. Another challenge we have is to come up with a way to present the generated PDF in a way that is interesting and catching for the reader to read. 

We still have to proof read the story generated and assess the relevance to prompts and how coherence and cohesion are applied in the story
