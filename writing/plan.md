# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary

This project aims to extend an existing children's story generation application to create a narrative that explores themes of "polar opposites," such as Vikings living in Asia or sumo wrestlers ice skating. The project will use OpenAI's API for both text generation (via GPT models) and image generation (via DALL-E) to create stories that defy traditional expectations by placing characters or events in unusual and contrasting settings. The final product will consist of 30,000 to 49,999 words and 30 to 50 images, bundled into a professionally formatted PDF that includes a title page, Table of Contents, and references to similar creative works or inspirations. This project aligns with our semester's exploration of prompt engineering and creative uses of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Peer works

TODO: Identify up to 3 works that you see as similar to what you're planning to do. If possible,
highlight particular pages, passages, or sections of those works with brief notes summarizing how
they motivate this project.

## Challenges

1. **Generating a Large Volume of Content:** Writing a story of up to 49,999 words will require extensive prompt engineering to maintain consistency and coherence across all sections. Ensuring continuity of plot elements, character development, and thematic consistency in such a long narrative may be challenging.

2. **Consistency Between Text and Images:** Generating images that accurately match the narrative description and the "polar opposite" theme can be difficult, as it may require multiple prompt refinements in DALL-E to achieve the intended style and context without repetitive elements. Addressing image variation while maintaining the theme across all images will be crucial.

3. **Technical Constraints and Costs:** API usage for such a large-scale project could be costly, especially with the word count and number of images required. Additionally, handling API rate limits, ensuring stable internet connectivity, and managing long-running operations to create a seamless workflow for generating and assembling the PDF could be complex.
